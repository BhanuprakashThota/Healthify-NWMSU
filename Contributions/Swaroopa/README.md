## Half day 1:

Time alotted : 4hrs = 1hr in class + 3hrs out of the class
- First a repo was created by our team lead and she invited us to accept the repo, after that we planned a schedule that will enable us to be successful.
- As a group, we figured out how each member can contribute to complete these group submissions and created clear tasks for each member. 
- After the clean and clear view on our proposal, I had started working on the administrator roles.
