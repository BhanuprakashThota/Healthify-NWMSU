# Healthify-NWMSU

## Statement Of Purpose:

“Our vision is to make healthy living easy, fun, and affordable for all”. The Healthify-NWMSU app can incorporate data from thousands of third-party apps that are designed to promote healthier habits — everything from nutrition to meditation to fitness. This app lets you keep all your health and fitness information under your control and in one place on your device.

## Overview:

Healthify-NWMSU isn’t the only fitness app that helps users track their diet and weight, and set fitness goals, but it certainly sets itself apart with its unique features and offerings. The free-to-download Healthify-NWMSU app allows users to track calories, set fitness goals, manage group challenges, view data from past challenges, participate in challenges, and measure progress. With a large database of foods and syncing capabilities with the industry’s leading fitness trackers, Healthify-NWMSU helps users track their daily food intake and measure calories accurately. As there is a saying “An app a day keeps the doctor away” our app justify this saying.

## User interface sketches:
Healthify_NWMSU application design and interface sketches are having a common frame layout for all the screens. The opening page looks similar to common login pages for all other the applications which can also redirect to admin page with having a button on it. In the next page, you can redirect to admin login upon admin btton in the first page. In the next page you can find the basic profile details of each individuals of users and admins as well. In the third page you can find the workout tracker which enables you to get all kinds of workout mentioned in it and  tracked based on the perofrmed activity by each user. In the last page you can find the diet trcker by adding all the food taken as calorie count based upon the timings of it and the amounts food taken by inserting in the page. And each page will have individual challenges based on the steps/workout/diet.

## Technology stack descriptions:

- 	In Healthify-NWMSU app we used set of technologies, software, and tools like java, 
java scripting, CSS, Html, pwa, XML which were used in the development and deployment of apps.

- **Java Scripting:** 

	As we all know JavaScript frameworks are well-suited to app development, as they can be used across a number of platforms, including iOS, Android, and Windows.
	We used java scripting in Healthify-NWMSU app for step counting, calorie counting.

- **HTML:**

	Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser, which can be assisted by technologies such as - --Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript
And there's no denying the fact that we used HTML in Healthify-NWMSU app, which acted as a foundation for the app development. We used different kinds HTML tags like ordered  list, unordered list, headings.

- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):**

	We used CSS for
	- Styling the text by using font properties 
	- For Changing dimensions
	- For Styling back grounds by changing the image & color
	- For setting the position of icon
	- For utilizing links through text decoration

- **PWA (Progressive Web Application):**

	As PWA is intended to work on any platform which uses a standards-compliant browser that allows users to interact with the app independent of the connection when we are running app on internet browser. It also used for us to catch the app data ahead of time.

- **XML (eXtensible Markup Language):**
	It is a markup language created as a standard way to encode data in internet-based applications. In Healthify-NWMSU app we used XML to create layout files for android users. We mainly used XML for namespace, texting and for dimensions like adjustments width and height of the layout. 


## ER Diagram

![ER Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sowmyathogiti/Healthify-NWMSU/master/ERD-Healthify.png)

 ### Entity Relation Description

 In this entity user's email, password, username, date of account created and last accessed are stored.
 where Email, Username, CreatedDate are primary keys. Also username, createdDate are foreign keys to Group, Challenge and DailyLevel entities.
 Each user will have only one DailyLevel. A dailyLevel must be assigned to atleast one user.
 A user can create multiple groups or no groups. Also there must be atleast one user who creates the group. 
 
 **2. DailyLevel**
 
 This entity stores the details of MeasurementDate, StepCount, Hydration, HoursOfSleep, FruitServings, VegetableServings, TotalServings.
 With the help of MeasurementDate we can retreive the activities done by the user on a particular day.
 
 **3. Group**
 
 This entity stores the details of group name, creator , date and last edited. 
 If the user has admin privilages then he can create the group.
 Here with the help Primary key Creator we can able to retreive the details of particular group.
